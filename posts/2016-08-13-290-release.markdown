Empires 2.9.0 "Battery"
August 13, 2016

# Features:
* Linux client and server, including [easy installation using LGSM](https://gameservermanagers.com/lgsm/emserver/)
* Building upgrades are now split into their own script definitions which allows values to be overridden when a building upgrades. For example turret damage can now be set when it is upgraded.
* Removed various code restrictions that meant only turrets could be upgraded. This means that new building upgrade definitions are now a possibility.
* Maximum carcass health is now defined in scripts, defaults to vehicle health.
* Concussion grenades re-added.
* Resource income now displays total income from all captured refineries and flags without using averaging; this should make it easier to notice when your income changes without random fluctuations. Resource deductions will display as and when they occur.
* Resources and wages will now display as rounded figures. This helps to make sure all the information stays visible without overlapping or going off-screen.
* Removed hardcoded layout for hud ammo indicator.
* Standing near an unbuilt refinery point shows a hint that you have to move away.

# Bugfixes:
* Made walls placable in Hammer.
* Fixed the bug causing players to spawn in Barracks facing East; players will now spawn facing the nearest exit.
* Fixed a bug where an engineer could place small walls even though they hit their limit.
* Fixed persistent wall ghosts when holstering engineer tool.
* Fixed a bug where the start position of a wall would be the map origin, meaning players would be unable to place a wall until they right clicked.
* Engineer recycling no longer gives more resources when recycling without repair upgrade.
* Turrets upgrade instantly after turret upgrade research.
* Fixed scout class being named assault at the end of a round.
* Removed unused emp_sv_refinery_interval cvar.
* Made default class on start of game engineer instead of scout.
* Fixed guard order drawing outline with an extra side.
* Fixed gui images becoming blurry on low graphics settings.
* Intro video has been fixed.
* Hints should no longer show when inside a vehicle; destroyed vehicles show their own hint.
* Engineer buildables no longer block building placement for commander.
* Fixed news panel in menu.

# Non-code changes:
* Added emp_money_2016 with prebuilt walls on the entrances.
* Fixed third flag on emp_escort giving Brenodi reinforcements multiple times.
* Added ocean water material for use in mapping.
* Improved NF jeep VGUI images.
* Hud style updated.
* Updated some collisions for old Brenodi props.
