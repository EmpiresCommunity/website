This month marks the ten year anniversary of Empires. In that time, we've seen one switch of engine, and many switches of team with only a few contributors left from the days of the [first release on moddb in 2006](http://www.moddb.com/mods/empires/news/empires-mod-released). May we have many years more to come!
